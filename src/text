AyaTok / QuranSwipe – App Explanation
1️⃣ Core Idea

AyaTok is a Quran reading app that shows one ayah (verse) at a time, in a vertical swipe format like TikTok.

Users swipe up to see the next ayah.

Every ayah the user reads earns points, inspired by the hadith: “Every letter you read from the Quran has 10 rewards.”

Each ayah is only shown once until the user completes the full Quran.

2️⃣ Follow Surah Feature

Every Surah is treated like an influencer.

Users can follow or unfollow specific Surahs.

The main feed shows only ayahs from the Surahs the user follows.

Users start following all Surahs by default, but can customize their feed.

3️⃣ Reading Modes

Main Feed (Randomized)

Shows a new ayah from the followed Surahs each swipe.

Manual Mode (Direct Surah Reading)

User enters a specific Surah and reads it manually.

Every ayah read counts for points and is marked as read, so it won’t appear in the main feed again.

4️⃣ Progress & Stats

Track how many ayahs read per Surah.

See completion percentage for each Surah.

Track total points earned and streaks.

Clicking on any ayah lets the user continue reading from that verse, even outside the main feed.

5️⃣ Audio Feature

Users can listen to recitations of each ayah via AlQuran.cloud API, free and streamed directly from CDN.

Multiple reciters are available (~35+ voices), e.g., Mishary Alafasy, Sudais, Husary.

Users can choose their favorite reciter.

6️⃣ PWA / Installable App

AyaTok is a Progressive Web App (PWA):

Can be installed on Android and iOS like a native app

Includes a real “Download / Install” button inside the app

7️⃣ Gamification & Motivation
